## Hi! This is my Personal Blog
###### https://eemery.github.io

#### Why I have a blog?
Well, one of my many passions in science is artificial intelligence. So, I decided to create this blog to write down the things I'm searching and learning. Explaining things, or at least pretend I'm explaining, is one of my favourite ways to better structure knowledge on my mind. And yes, I like saying "artificial intelligence" rather than "machine learning" or "deep learning" because it sounds like I'm in a sci-fi movie.

#### Sugestions or contributions?
Feel free do mark issues or send pull requests here on GitHub, they'll be always welcomed.
